(👋) Hi, I’m @edishko!

(👀) I’m interested in computer science, programming, and technology. 

(🌱) I’m currently learning new programming languages and frameworks to expand my skillset. 

(💞️) I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that solve interesting problems and have a positive impact on society. 

(📫) How to reach me: You can contact me through my GitHub profile or by email at [email address].

(💻) Here are some of the projects I have worked on:

  Project 1: A C++ link shortcut program for zoom meetings - Slink.
  Project 2: A Python script that automates data entry and document creation.
  Project 3: A Python program that scrapes data and makes annoucments on discord.

(🌟) I am particularly proud of Slink, as it was my first important project.

(📚) In addition to my coding projects, I also enjoy watching stuff about computer science and technology. Some of my favorite Youtube channels are:
